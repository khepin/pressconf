	  		<h2>What is this?</h2>
	  		<p>
	  			<strong>PressConf</strong> is a website to let you hold video press conferences
	  			online. You setup a press conference, others can join it and listen to what you have to say.
	  		</p>
	  		<p>Only you the creator of the conference is allowed to talk by default.
	  		Other participants can request you to let them ask a question in which case
	  		you will see a <button class="tiny question">Go!</button> button next to their name. By clicking this
	  		button you give them the ability to broadcast their question to all the attendees of
	  		the conference. You can stop their question at any time by clicking the
	  		<button class="tiny question"><i class="fa fa-ban"></i></button> button that appears
	  		after they start talking.</p>
	  		<h3>Should I use it?</h3>
	  		<p>Most probably no! Not in its current stage. This is just a demo,
	  		it is <em>buggy and not very secure</em> in the current stage. Use it if you want
	  		to have fun and play around. Not more.</p>
	  		<h3>If you still want to try:</h3>
			<form ng-hide="user.username" ng-submit="login(username)">
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
			  <div class="row">
			    <div class="large-12 columns">
			      <label>Before we start, we'll need to know your name
			        <input type="text" placeholder="Bob" ng-model="username" />
			      </label>
			      <button type="submit" class="button expand">That's how they call me!</button>
